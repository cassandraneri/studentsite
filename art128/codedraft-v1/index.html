                    <p>Hawaii Cat Cafe is a small cafe where you can socialize with adoptable rescue cats while enjoying a handcrafted beverage and European style pastries. All of the cats and kittens at the cafe are rescued by either our staff or the Humane Society.</p>
                    <p>“We are dedicated to changing the lives of sheltered cats by finding them forever homes, and educating the public about responsible pet ownership.”</p>
                    <p>Adopting cats from our cafe opens up space to rescue more cats. Together, we’re reducing euthanasia rates. Hawai‘i Cat Cafe allows potential adopters to get to know the cats’ personalities in a fun environment. Cats have significantly more exposure and opportunities to be adopted.</p>

                            <p>We’re sure you’re cat is great, and we’d love to see pictures of him/her, but for the health and safety of our cats, outside pets are not allowed. </p>       
                            <p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>I can't keep my cat anymore, will you take it?</strong></p>
                            <p>Although we are partnered with a shelter, we are not an animal shelter ourselves. We can not take in animals off the streets or from individuals. </p> 
                            <p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Can I take home one of the cats at the cafe?</strong></p>
                            <p>YES!!! That’s what we’re here for! We do our best to review applications immediately so your new family member can go home with you that same day, but sometimes it can take up to 3 business days.</p> 
                            <p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Are children allowed to visit the Cat Lounge?</strong></p>
                            <p>Yes. We believe it is important for children to have the opportunity to spend time  with animals and learn how to behave around them. You know your child best, and will be fully responsible for their behavior. Rules for respecting the cats will be strictly enforced and we will not hesitate to ask you and your child to leave without a refund if their behavior poses a threat to the cats.
                                Children 15 and under must be accompanied by an adult. No more than two children under 12 per one adult. Please contact us if you have any questions.</p> 
                            <p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Do you accept walk-ins for the Cat Lounge?</strong></p>
                            <p>Yes, but we highly recommend that you make a reservation. We limit the amount of people in the Cat Lounge to ensure the safety and happiness of the cats.</p> 
                            <p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Where are you located?</strong></p>
                            <p>415 Kapahulu Avenue. We are located right next to the Texaco gas station.
                            </p> 
                            <p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Do you have parking?</strong></p>
                            <p>Yes, we have 3 reserved spots in the back of the building. If those are full, Kapahulu Avenue has lots of available metered street parking, and First Hawaiian Bank next to us has a pay to park option.</p>
